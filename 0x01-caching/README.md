## Caching

### Background
In this project, you will explore different caching algorithms to improve data retrieval efficiency.

### Learning Objectives
- Understand the concept of a caching system and its importance in optimizing data access.
- Explore various caching algorithms such as FIFO, LIFO, LRU, MRU, and LFU.
- Recognize the purpose and limitations of caching systems.

### Requirements
- Implement caching algorithms in Python.
- Ensure all scripts are executable and follow the `pycodestyle` style guidelines.
- Include a `README.md` file providing project overview and instructions.
- Document all modules, classes, and functions with clear explanations of their purpose.

### Tasks
1. **Basic Dictionary Caching:**
   - Create a caching system using a basic dictionary approach.

2. **FIFO (First-In, First-Out) Caching:**
   - Implement a caching system that follows the FIFO algorithm.

3. **LIFO (Last-In, First-Out) Caching:**
   - Develop a caching system based on the LIFO algorithm.

4. **LRU (Least Recently Used) Caching:**
   - Implement a caching system that employs the LRU algorithm.

5. **MRU (Most Recently Used) Caching:**
   - Create a caching system using the MRU algorithm.

### Additional Information
- Use the provided `BaseCaching` class as the parent class for your caching systems.
- Ensure your implementations handle edge cases and maintain efficient data retrieval.
- Test your caching systems thoroughly to verify their correctness and efficiency.
